# SPA Routing Fix Guide

## 🚨 Issue: 404 Errors on Direct URL Access

### Problem Description:
When users directly access URLs like `veekdays.com/services`, they get a 404 error because the server doesn't know how to handle client-side routing in React SPAs.

### ✅ Solution: Added SPA Routing Support

## 📁 Files Created/Modified:

### 1. `public/_redirects` (Netlify)
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
- Redirects all routes to index.html
- Allows React Router to handle routing

### 2. `public/404.html` (GitHub Pages)
- Custom 404 page with TechSolutions branding
- Automatically redirects to homepage
- Includes GTM tracking for 404 errors
- Professional fallback page

### 3. `vercel.json` (Vercel)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Updated `vite.config.ts`
- Added build optimization for better performance
- Ensures proper asset handling

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions:

### For GitHub Pages:
1. **Build your project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy using the GitHub Pages plugin:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **The `404.html` file will handle routing automatically**

### For Netlify:
1. **Build your project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `dist` folder**
   - The `_redirects` file will handle routing

### For Vercel:
1. **Connect your repository to Vercel**
   - The `vercel.json` file will handle routing automatically

## 🔍 Testing the Fix:

### Before Fix:
- ❌ `veekdays.com/services` → 404 Error
- ❌ Direct URL access fails
- ❌ Browser refresh on sub-pages fails

### After Fix:
- ✅ `veekdays.com/services` → Loads correctly
- ✅ Direct URL access works
- ✅ Browser refresh works on all pages
- ✅ Professional 404 page as fallback

## 📊 Routes That Will Now Work:

- ✅ `/` (Homepage)
- ✅ `/services`
- ✅ `/products`
- ✅ `/case-studies`
- ✅ `/about`
- ✅ `/process`
- ✅ `/demo`
- ✅ `/blog`
- ✅ `/blog/erp`
- ✅ `/blog/crm`
- ✅ `/blog/oms`

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Deploy the changes** to your hosting platform
2. **Test all routes** by accessing them directly
3. **Verify GTM tracking** works on all pages
4. **Check that 404 page** appears for invalid routes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### If routes still don't work:

1. **Clear browser cache** and test again
2. **Check hosting platform settings** for SPA support
3. **Verify file permissions** on hosting platform
4. **Test in incognito mode** to rule out cache issues

### For GitHub Pages:
- Ensure repository is public or you have GitHub Pro
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the correct branch is selected for deployment

### For Netlify:
- Check that `_redirects` file is in the root of your build output
- Verify Netlify is reading the redirects correctly

### For Vercel:
- Ensure `vercel.json` is in the root of your project
- Check Vercel deployment logs for any errors
