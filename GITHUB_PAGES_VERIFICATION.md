# GitHub Pages SPA Routing - Verification Guide

## ✅ **Fix Applied: GitHub Pages SPA Routing**

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Added GitHub Pages SPA Routing Script** to both `index.html` and `404.html`
2. **Deployed the updated build** to `gh-pages` branch
3. **Used the proven spa-github-pages solution**

### 📋 **How It Works:**

#### **Step 1: User visits `/services`**
- GitHub Pages serves `404.html` (because `/services` doesn't exist as a file)

#### **Step 2: 404.html Redirect Script**
- Captures the URL (`/services`)
- Redirects to `/?/services` with encoded path
- This happens instantly

#### **Step 3: index.html Routing Script**
- Detects the `/?/services` format
- Uses `window.history.replaceState()` to change URL back to `/services`
- React Router takes over and loads the Services page

### 🚀 **Testing Instructions:**

#### **Wait Time: 2-5 minutes**
GitHub Pages deployment can take a few minutes to propagate. Please wait 2-5 minutes after deployment before testing.

#### **Test 1: Direct URL Access**
1. **Open a new incognito/private window**
2. **Go directly to**: `https://veekdays.com/services`
3. **Expected Result**: Page loads correctly (may flash briefly during redirect)

#### **Test 2: Browser Refresh**
1. **Navigate to Services from homepage**
2. **Press F5 or Cmd+R to refresh**
3. **Expected Result**: Page stays on Services, doesn't go to 404

#### **Test 3: All Routes**
Test these URLs directly:
- `https://veekdays.com/products`
- `https://veekdays.com/case-studies`
- `https://veekdays.com/about`
- `https://veekdays.com/blog`

### 🔍 **If Still Not Working:**

#### **1. Clear Cache**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or test in incognito mode

#### **2. Wait for Deployment**
- GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes to deploy changes
- Check deployment status in GitHub repository → Settings → Pages

#### **3. Verify Deployment**
```bash
# Check if the fix is deployed by viewing the source
curl -s https://veekdays.com/ | grep "spa-github-pages"
```
Should return the routing script if deployed correctly.

#### **4. Check GitHub Pages Status**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Verify it shows "Your site is published at..."
4. Check the last deployment time

### 📊 **Expected Behavior:**

#### **✅ Working (After Fix):**
- `/services` → Loads Services page
- Browser refresh works on any page
- Direct URL access works
- May see brief redirect flash (normal for GitHub Pages)

#### **❌ Still Broken:**
- Gets stuck on 404 page
- Redirects to homepage instead of correct page
- Browser refresh breaks the page

### 🎯 **Deployment Status:**

- ✅ **Build Completed**: Successfully built and deployed
- ✅ **Scripts Added**: SPA routing scripts in both files
- ✅ **Pushed to gh-pages**: Changes are live
- ⏳ **Propagation**: May take 2-10 minutes to be active

### 📞 **Next Steps:**

1. **Wait 5 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Test in incognito mode** to avoid cache issues
3. **Try direct URL access** to verify the fix
4. **Report back** if still experiencing issues
